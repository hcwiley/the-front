  <em><strong>Post-Cards from New Orleans<br>
  <br>
  </strong></em>For ten years, the University of New Orleans and the City of Innsbruck have held an annual artist exchange. Every summer a few graduating UNO, MFA students are granted a show in old-town Innsbruck, and every academic year, a few Austrian artists mount a show at the UNO Fine Arts Gallery. To commemorate the tenth anniversary of this international event, UNO Fine Arts Chair and Exhibitions Director Christopher Saucedo organized a show of ten New Orleans based artists who have participated in this exchange over the years and bundled them together into a exhibition that opened on July 5th at Galerie im Andechshof. Saucedo intended that the show would convey, to the Innsbruck audience, an aesthetic of tourist&rsquo;s snapshots of the dynamic and unique, visual voice of our home town. </p>
<p>The exhibition has now traveled back to New Orleans and will be on view at The Front from September 11th until October 3rd. Participating artists are Jessica Goldfinch, Dan Tague, Alex Podesta, Chris Jahnke, Maxx Sizeler, Srdjan Loncar, Laura Gipson, Rachel Jones, Monica Zeringue and Aaron McNamee.</p>
<p>Commemorative souvenir post-card booklet catalogs of the show are available for $10. All proceeds go towards supporting the New Orleans/Innsbruck Exchange Program.</p>

<p>Room 4: Julie Doucet<br>
  <em><strong>La Vie, La Mort, Amour, Tendresse</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p>Julie Doucet is a celebrated comic artist whose works, such as Dirty Plotte (published by Drawn &amp; Quarterly and winner of the Harvey Award for Best New Talent), document her day to day life, her dreams, angsts, and fantasies. In the late 90&rsquo;s Doucet abandoned the medium of comics and began working in printmaking, artist&rsquo;s books, and collage. The series of collages in this exhibition represent Doucet&rsquo;s first attempts at working with cut and paste images and words. Despite the significant shift in media, the same themes in her comic work are present in these collages: life, death, love, and tenderness.</p>

<p>This recent body of work consists of snapshots taken by Bravo while meandering about the city of Chicago. His unexpected juxtapositions of the snapshots expose potential relationships between the seemingly unrelated.</p>

<p>Backyard: Ben Fox-McCord<br>
  <em><strong>A Quiet Stroll</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p>This piece is about burgeoning relationships , a fear of portraiture, the original Nintendo game <em>Rampage</em>, and a desire to rip shit up now and then.<br>
  <br>
  Ben Fox-McCord grew up in Knoxville, TN, and studied printmaking at the Ohio State University and the University of Tennessee, Knoxville. The focus of his work for the past several years has been on large scale installation pieces, but he continues to make prints on paper and textiles. Ben is a recent transplant to New Orleans.<br>
