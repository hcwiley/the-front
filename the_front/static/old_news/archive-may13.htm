<p><strong>Maria Dumlao</strong></p>
<p><em>Untitled (The Big Easy)</em> [2013, video and sound, 11 minutes] is a reimagining of a 1987 American crime drama film in which characters and dialogue are redacted, thereby altering the focus from the film&rsquo;s narrative to a reframed view of New Orleans landscape in which the film is set.</p>
<p>Maria Dumlao&rsquo;s work has been exhibited and screened at Art in General and Momenta Art Gallery in NYC, The Contemporary Museum in Hawaii and internationally. Dumlao has been awarded residencies at Experimental Television Center in Owego, NY, and at free103point9&rsquo;s Wave Farm in Acra, NY. Her work with Brainstormers has appeared at Brooklyn Museum of Art and Bronx Museum of Art (a collaboration with Guerilla Girls) and received funding from The Puffin Foundation. She received an MFA from Hunter College and currently teaches at Bucks County Community College in Newtown, PA.</p>

<p><strong>Julianna Foster</strong></p>
<p>Foster&rsquo;s most recent work, <em>Swell</em>, depicts a fantastic event that allegedly occurred last year in a small coastal town. As the story goes, a nor&rsquo;easter was forming in the Atlantic Ocean from the remnants of a Hurricane when several residents reported seeing something they had never witnessed before&mdash;and have never seen since.</p>
<p>Like <em>Kirkwood</em>, Foster&rsquo;s previous series of images that explored a similarly unexplained phenomenon that took place in that small suburban community, <em>Swell </em>operates on several levels to recount the stories of what happened through a series of photographs. The series <em>Kirkwood</em>, depicts fantastic scenarios that occur in everyday settings. Unlike much of her past work, the human figure is absent in these images. But traces of its existence can be found in the vacant domestic architecture and in the events that take place within it. Tapping into the tradition of magical realism, these images depict the &quot;unreal&quot; in an utterly realistic manner. Foster began exploring these ideas in a previous series of work, From Morning On, which took its inspiration from the Russian filmmaker Andrei Tarkovsky and was exhibited at Vox Populi in Philadelphia in 2009.</p>
<p>Previous work represents distinct narratives; which are informed for the most part by Foster&rsquo;s interest in cinema and its relationship to photography. The images reflect an ongoing investigation into the ways that the photographic image can portray a psychological relationship between the characters in each image or series of images and of course between the viewer and the subject. By exploring how the individual image can transcend its own limits, and by association, provide the opportunity for a pictorial narrative to unfold each story forms something of a larger narrative that continues to reveal itself in a variety of forms, be it a photograph, book or video. All of which rely on the fundamentals of narrative to examine and comment on the human experience.</p>
<p>Julianna Foster lives in Philadelphia and teaches at The University of the Arts, Photography Program and MFA Book Arts and Printmaking Department, where she received her MFA in 2006. Foster has been an artist member of Vox Populi Gallery in Philadelphia since 2006, where she has had Four solo exhibitions, including From Morning On, Kirkwood and most recently Swell in 2012. She has also participated in group exhibitions in London and NYC. In addition to her individual ventures, over the years she has collaborated with various artists on projects that include creating artist multiples, artist books and series of photographs. Foster received a Faculty Professional Development Grant from the Pre-College Programs to attend classes at International Center for Photography and was a recipient of the Faculty Enrichment grant awards in 2010 and 2012.</p>
<p>Exhibitions in Philadelphia include, Philadelphia Art Alliance, Painted Bride Art Center and Rosenwald Wolf Gallery. Other exhibitions include, PhotoSynthesis, Pennsylvania College of Art and Design; NewSpace Center for Photography, Portland, Oregon; Bulk, Hanes Fine Art Center, Chapel Hill, NC; Landing Place, Manfesta 8, Murcia, Spain and X-Initiative, No Sale for Sale, A festival for Independents, London and NYC.</p>

<p><strong>Christopher P. McManus</strong></p>
<p>In movies, we know the CGI beast will be defeated despite how powerful it appears to be. The countless hours a team of animators have put into its creation always comes to a similar end. After a fantastic display of super strength, after a gruesome show of vitality, after we hear the monstrous scream, the hero is inevitably victorious.</p>
<p>In this piece, the beast is a reptilian alien. It's been decapitated in some absurdly matched battle. Its head lies on the ground. As Michael Haneke shows us in <em>Funny Games</em>, the audience is complicit; bloodthirsty, we don't give much more thought to what's dead, even when it doesn't make any sense. Why isn't the beast victorious? Why isn't the movie as inventive as the monster? Instead the beast, a creation of intense labor, gives way to the same, expected, ending.</p>

<p>The newspaper piece at the Front Gallery <em>The Couch Sonata</em> is a cliff notes if you will to the themes in the book Guilty Pleasures I am working on finishing. Please enjoy a copy and please pay as you wish. Your support is greatly appreciated.</p>
<p>My current project, a book titled <em>Guilty Pleasures</em>, looks at finding comfort during winter. The images speak through visual pun and metaphor. I often takes diaristic liberties and embraces serendipity, building images that refer to something other than what is named or described in the frame: something intangible such as longing, intimacy, and solitude. Winter has its own vernacular of an inside and outside. Strung together are lists of simple comforts and tactile groupings which all contrast with the harshness that winter serves. Relief is offered through humor as it transforms coping into a joy that makes moving forward more meaningful.</p>
<p>I recently completed my MFA in Transmedia/Art Photography at Syracuse University. After graduating from NYU&rsquo;s Tisch School of the Arts with a BFA in Photography my work appeared in various editorial publications worldwide. In 2008 I published my first long-term book project entitled <em>Half Life: A Portrait of Lauren</em>. The book documents the life and suicide of a close friend and my relationship to her. I have recently completed residencies at the Visual Studies Workshop in Rochester NY, The Millay Colony for the Arts in Austerlitz, NY and at the Contemporary Artists Center at Woodside in Troy, NY. I have taught courses at Syracuse University, Salem Community College, was a visiting faculty member at Bennington College in 2011, and am currently teaching a darkroom based course at the College of New Jersey. I am an artist member of Vox Populi, and my studio is based in Philadelphia, PA.</p>

<p><strong>Tim Portlock</strong></p>
<p>Tim Portlock was born in Chicago which inspired his lifelong interest in the dialogue between place and the formation of identity. Educated primarily as a traditional visual artist he has worked as a community-based muralist as well as a studio painter. Currently Portlock&rsquo;s art incorporates traditional art conventions and new media tools, such as <em>Ghost City</em> a series of computer- generated prints based on the abandoned buildings within five-mile radius of his house. Some of Portlock&rsquo;s other recent work uses 3D gaming technology to simulate real world, historic and imagined spaces. He is a 2011 Pew Fellow and has exhibited in France, the UK, Poland, Argentina, Austria and Japan as well as other venues North America.</p>

<p><strong>Chloe Isadora Reison</strong></p>
<p>With this piece I became interested in the dilution of a source, and the subsequent blurring of boundaries that occurs between that which was once significant and that which is ordinary. <em>Four Times Removed (Mies van der Rohe) </em>depicts a marble wall captured in a photograph, translated into a painting, and then rephotographed to become a decorative banner. The final piece is at once a celebration and desecration of Mies van der Rohe&rsquo;s aesthetic tenor.</p>
<p>Chloe Isadora Reison received her BS in Studio Art from Skidmore College in 2008, and her MFA from the University of Pennsylvania in 2012. She is currently living and working in Philadelphia, PA.</p>

<p><strong>Alexander Rosenberg </strong></p>
<p>My work explores identity through experiments in longing and failure. I am prone to dreaming of time travel, an impossible endeavor, but one that can be distantly approached through historical research. If the past is a living thing, a body that is constantly changing as a result of its study, then maybe I can give form to these dreams by interacting with this organism. What is the difference between participating in history and changing it from a distance? Can I interact with the past by changing myself today?</p>
<p>Alexander Rosenberg is an artist and educator at the University of the Arts in Philadelphia. He received a BFA from Rhode Island School of Design&rsquo;s Glass program and has been fascinated with the material ever since. After a period of freelance fabrication and assisting several established artists with studio work and research, Alexander went on to MIT to study in a 2&shy;year MS program in visual studies. Here, he continued his investigation of glass as a material, in conjunction with an interdisciplinary artistic practice that crossed over into many other media. Since earning his masters degree, Alexander continues his artistic practice with artist residencies, public performances and exhibitions locally and internationally. He now lives and works in Philadelphia where he heads a glass program.</p>

<p><strong>Leigh Van Duzer</strong></p>
<p>Leigh Van Duzer combines images of crystalline forms, skeletons, mountains and architectural construction to compare systems of building in her photo-based work. Both her two-dimensional prints and cut paper photo-based sculptures spring from her interest in organic and orthogonal forms. At the heart of her work is a search for order and organization, structure and planning. Van Duzer combines categories of objects that mimic each others&rsquo; foundations and shapes them into forms that she can control. </p>
<p>Leigh Van Duzer is a Philadelphia-area artist whose work has been shown internationally, including galleries in New York, Philadelphia, Washington DC and Paris. Leigh received her MFA from the University of Pennsylvania in 2010, and her BA from Hampshire College in 2001. In 2010 Leigh was awarded the Daisy Soros Prize to attend the Salzburg International Summer Academy of Fine Arts in Austria. She has also received fellowships to the Vermont Studio Center and the Hambidge Center. </p>
