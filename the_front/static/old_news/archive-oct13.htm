<p class="style24"><em>Tokyo Art Lab @ The Front </em></p>
<p><em>Tokyo Art Lab @ The Front</em> marks the first international exchange as well as the first curatorial collective to be included in The Front&rsquo;s Collective Exchange Program. For the exhibition at The Front, Tokyo Art Lab members, Kentaro Chiba, Emma Ota, Keiko Kamma, Syuta Mitomo, and Taisuke Morishita, will be curating a group exhibition of Japanese Artists. Ginza Art &amp; Concept Laboratory established in January 2005 is an art space on non-profit-basis that is producing art shows mainly focusing on multiculturalism, multimedia and scouting emerging artists. </p>

<p>Room 1:</p>
<p><span class="style17">Taisuke Morishita</span></p>
<p><em><strong>Taisuke Morishita</strong></em><br>
</p>
<p>I exhibit by the theme &quot;Silence Is Violence&quot; and &quot;Invisibleness Is Violence&quot;.<br>
  Silence and invisibleness are connected with man's threat and mentally damage is given to man.<br>
  This is that I feel after 3.11 and the nuclear power plant accident in Japan.<br>
  After the accident radioactivity is not visible, people have also become silent.<br>
  It is a mentally threat as that is going to ruin.<br>
  I think that man has the right to speak having considered freely or to make visible what is not visible. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Morishita graduated from the Art and Design College of Musashino Art University. His artistic expressions have been presented using multiple media including painting, installation, video, light art, photograph, CG, acoustic rendering, and performance and he also organized art symposiums. He repeatedly performed &quot;Les Rallizes Denudes,&quot; a kind of original form of what is called Noise Performance now, with Keiji Haino, his contemporary, in the 70s when he was a student. He participated in the Niigata Contemporary Music Festival (produced by Akira Aida) in 1972. He mainly produced videos in the 80s. His video art was selected by the International Video Art Exhibition Infermental, and &quot;JANE-DOE 66&quot; is stored in the Media Arts Museum ZKM in Germany. He submitted his work to the 2nd European Media Art Festival (Osnabruck, Germany in 1989). He produced a collaborative art video with Yayoi Kusama and the video was shown at Sogetsu Museum in 1992. </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He produced a number of works of art using bar codes to question the subjects of hyper-capitalism and globalization in the 90s, which he exhibited in Italy, France, Poland, USA and Japan. Among them, he presents issues such as multinational companies that made South Eastern Asia their factory region, the core and end of multiculturalism, regional differences and gender in his &quot;DE ABJECTION&quot; work. He explained the reason why he used bar codes as a motif saying, &quot;It characterizes a historical turning point where the emergence of computers produced a massive amount of codes that we can _t decode. We are reduced to statistical numbers and it has encouraged the way of thinking that facilitates us to see a collective action merely as a sort of sample or pattern. It tells us that we live in an era when we disrespect the dignity of human and at the same time our sufferings are also eased. I also think that such an environment suspends our modern thoughts, approaches to a natural state, a sort of apathy, and reawakes animism and primitivism." </p>
<p> &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He solo-exhibited &quot;Cockroach&quot; (Fusion Arts Museum) where a cockroach was used as an allegory symbolizing the uneven distribution of American capitalism, and held other exhibitions several times in New York. He held the &quot;Bar-code performance&quot; in Venetia Biennale every time. He also showed Japanese post-war culture using ceramic dolls for export produced during the USA occupation in &quot;Made in Occupied Japan&quot;, and recently developed the &quot;Eco@Asianism&quot; movement with Rena Masuyama and others, that presents issues such as environmental problems, contemporary architectures and town planning through art that have stemmed from the asbestos crisis. </p>

<p><em><strong>Keiko Kamma </strong></em></p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kamma studied comparative culture, graduating from the literature department of Seikei University, Tokyo. She started her career as a painter in the late 80's and was awarded the Yasuda Kasai Art Foundation Prize as well as the <em>L'OEil </em> prize from <em>L'OEil </em>, a French art magazine. She moved over to contemporary art in the early 90's by presenting a conceptual photograph series of <em>&nbsp; Ready-Made Phenomena </em>, in which she captures on the streets of New York, Paris, Berlin, London, Venice, Montreal, Seoul, Shanghai and Tokyo. &nbsp; These ARTISTIC and ART-LIKE phenomena trecall to her Abstract Expressionism and Contemporary Art, using a montage photographic technique, to present "art that already existing within the mind." &nbsp; The subject matter of &nbsp; "art existing as a phenomenon without the need of creation" has formed the foundation of her art work since then. She has developed her artistic expression mainly through installation and performance and has participated in many art and performance festivals held in France, Italy, Canada, USA and Japan since 1997. &nbsp; </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the <em>Mirage Project, </em> initiated in 1997, a consistent state of abandonment is exhibited. Here the exhibited objects, including goods, texts, sounds and images appear seemingly unrelated to each other, yet function as a form of mirror reflecting the audience's internal thought, creating a new poetic association between each fragment through the consciousness of the audience. This work is exhibited as an installation, yet Kamma refers to its form as material poetry. </p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her recent exhibitions include <em>Tsuki - The Moon </em> (UK-Japan Project, &nbsp; Kodai-ji temple, Kyoto, 2008), <em>Non/Appearance </em>(Dada Docot / Philippines + Keiko Kamma.

<p><em><strong>Jomi Kim </strong></em><br>
  curated by Kentaro Chiba and Emma Ota<br>
</p>
<p>Bought a pomegranate after a long time.<br>
  As I peel the skin off, the grotesque piece appears unexpectedly.<br>
  Then it made me think the rumor that &nbsp; "Pomegranate tastes like human flesh" when I was little.<br>
  Well, the piece in my palm is rather an animal piece than to call as a fruit.<br>
  Pomegranate has quite a few myths and superstitions such as Kishibojin in Japan and Persephone in Greece. &nbsp;<br>
  It is understandable why these myths have been said after peeling a pomegranate skin.<br>
  There are quite a few myths and superstitions around our daily life and it could be said that there might be every reason to be said so.<br>
  When I think about it, I cannot help thinking that this way of looking at our surroundings might be a very humanly and primitive way of looking and is important in our life. </p>
