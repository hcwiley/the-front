  Ashley Hope Carlisle: <em>Dissemination Nation</em></p>
<p><em>Dissemination Nation </em>deals with connections made between plant life and the human condition. &nbsp; What makes us comfortable and uncomfortable and how do we deal with the inevitability of surviving as inhabitants on this planet? &nbsp; Uncomfortable circumstances are reality, so instead of dwelling on this veracity of life, I seek to bring hopeful awareness to happenings that normally evoke anxiety and fear. &nbsp; Using materials as my vocabulary, I strive to glorify the illusion or false comfort of protection. I utilize formal concerns, the sensitivity of touch, and luscious materiality to produce works that take both roles as visual guidance when confronting the uncomfortable, as well as reassurance when dealing with the inevitable. &nbsp; An optimistic role is taken with the visual conversation I build, so regardless of physical pain, ego stampedes, or moments of smallness, I line my ideas with silver to exhilarate and infuse the viewer with hope. </p>
Ashley Hope Carlisle is originally from New Orleans, Louisiana, received her BFA in Sculpture from The University of Southern Mississippi and her MFA in Sculpture from The University of Georgia. &nbsp; She has been teaching for the past 6 years as Assistant Professor of Art in Sculpture at the University of Wyoming in Laramie, Wyoming. &nbsp; Her work has been exhibited in galleries all over the south, east, and western U.S. as well as in England and Italy.

  Room 3 <br>David Jones </p>
<p>David Jones' work incorporates a wide range of materials and is typically made up of model scale objects that are composed into larger room size landscape installations. &nbsp; Utilizing elements from western landscape imagery and scale shifts, Jones builds constructions that address some of the current socioeconomic issues that have had a global impact. &nbsp;&nbsp; </p>
David Jones, originally from Augusta, Georgia, received his BFA in sculpture from the University of Georgia and his MFA in sculpture from the University of Tennessee.

    Sesthasak Boonchai: <em>Between the Searching and the Need to Work it Out</em></p>
<p>This new installation is a conscious and conscientious look at the obliquely synchronous lives of two close friends. Consisting of photographic and text-based objects, <em>Between the Searching and the Need to Work it Out</em>, quietly ponders patriarchal and marital anaclisis. </p>
<p>Sesthasak Boonchai is an artist currently based in Brooklyn, NY and is a faculty member in the Photography Department at the School of Visual Arts in Manhattan.</p>
