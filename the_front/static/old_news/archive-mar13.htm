<p>This show will feature new pieces in Bravo's continuing series of large scale self portrait wall drawings. Drawn directly on the wall, the figures interact and struggle with the space around them, engaging architectural elements, and yearning to break free from the confines of the gallery walls they're seemingly trapped within.<br clear="ALL">

<p>James Esber<br>
  <em><strong>Parts and Labor<br>
    </strong></em><br>
  In his new work, James Esber continues to address notions of distortion and perception by mining the pawed-over icons of popular culture. In new paintings on canvas, Esber presents an array of visual puzzles; cutting, fragmenting and distorting found images before remaking them in calligraphic layered strokes of paint. These paintings invite the viewer to embrace absurdity or force a remedy by mentally bandaging holes and reconfiguring forms.<br>
  <br>
  James Esber&rsquo;s exhibition <em>Parts and Labor </em>will include a fragment from <em>This is not a portrait</em>, a group drawing project in which he enlisted a broad range of people (young and old, artists and non-artists), to translate his 2005 pen and ink drawing of Osama bin Laden. The project began in 2009 and terminated with the death of bin Laden in May, 2011. Fifteen of the pieces presented at the Front Gallery were made by New Orleans residents during a visit in December and January of 2010/11. Esber wants to &ldquo;create an arena in which the distinction between skilled and unskilled hands is irrelevant and personal touch becomes paramount. In the process of remaking every line, each participant may or may not be thinking about Bin Laden; the paper may be turned sideways or upside-down.&rdquo; The final product is in no sense a conventional portrait. It is arguably not a portrait at all, but the re-presentation of a mask-like portrait image.<br>
  <br>
  Writing in the New York Times, Roberta Smith referred to <em>This is not a portrait</em> as &ldquo;a dizzying, slightly hallucinatory, one-rogue rogue&rsquo;s gallery&rdquo; and &ldquo;a meditation on drawing and individuality. Each image is in a way a self-portrait of its maker, just as the totality is a kind of group portrait of an Esberian community.&rdquo; (Dec. 23, 2010)</p>

<p>Jane Fine<br>
  <em><strong>Fatty Was An Angel</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p>Located on the border between figuration and abstraction, my paintings are raucous battlefields. On their surface, hard-edged painting delivers a sucker punch to biomorphic abstraction; figure and ground are dueling and there is a fight to the death between drawing and painting. <br>
  <br>
  The specific nature of each painting is determined by a mash-up of painterly technique including vigorous brushwork, doodley marker lines, areas of flat color, and glossy pours of multi-colored acrylic paint. Through these techniques I take on multiple personalities. At moments I am mimicking an anxious Pollock or an exuberant deKooning. At other times I feel like my Grandmother, caressing the surface with delicate line as if I am embroidering the family&rsquo;s tablecloths, although in my own line work I straddle gender roles, mixing hearts and flowers with bullet traces and gunfire. <br>
  <br>
  For several years I explored a very literal notion of the battlefield. It began in 2003 at the start of the Iraq war, as the pours began to suggest camouflage, central forms turned into tanks, and rifles started to poke out from multiple openings in the painted surface. By 2007, sick of war, I granted abstraction a temporary victory. In several paintings from that year, the struggle between figure and ground takes precedence over more earthly battles, leaving only vestiges of guns and barbed wire drifting through the painting. <br>
  <br>
  Recently, I have discovered a new sense of freedom in the studio as I&rsquo;ve let many of my own rules and methodology slip away in favor of a more intuitive system for building paintings. <br>
  <br>
  The newest paintings unfold in wide-open spaces full of verdant foliage and flowery psychedelia. Planes, guns, and melting forms mingle with trees, blossoms and cartoony cottages. Human-like figures have made a few tentative appearances into these previously uninhabited landscapes. Fully informed by the modern miseries of war and climate change, collapse and decay are ever-present. A myriad of supports try to stop the slide toward entropy: scaffolding, nails, bricks, boards and patches, yet the drip and ooze pop up everywhere. <br>
  <br>
  Every depicted conflict in these paintings also functions as a metaphor for the battles inherent in my own creative process: trying to make something from nothing, intention from accident, illusion from flatness and meaning from doubt. The outcome of these battles is redemption. Using painterly invention as a sign for optimism, the work becomes celebratory. It&rsquo;s a party room, even if all the guests are scarred and bandaged. </p>
