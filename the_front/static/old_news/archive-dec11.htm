</strong>Ryan Trecartin &amp; Lizzie Fitch: Q &amp; A </em></p>
<p><img src="archive images/Dec 10- Jan 8 12/front_ryan&Lizzie_web.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="408"></p>
<p>The Front will host a question and answer style lecture with artists Ryan Trecartin and Lizzie Fitch at 5pm, Dec. 10, 2011, before the St. Claude Arts District's Second Saturday openings. &nbsp; Familiar to longtime Bywater residents as 'the kids who had cool concerts at the &quot;free stuff&quot; house on Mazant St.'; Ryan and Lizzie since then have become stars of the contemporary art world. They will return to Mazant St. on Dec. 10th to share their work and talk about contemporary art today. The event is free and open to the public. </p>
<p>Their video, sculpture and installation work has been featured in some of the most prominent museums and galleries worldwide. Recent exhibitions include: </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>2011/12 </strong> MoMA PS1, New York: 19 June-3 September 2011/Museum of Contemporary Art, Miami: 24 June-4 September 2011/Modern Art Museum, Paris: 18 October - 8 January 2012 </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>2010 </strong> Any Ever, The Museum of Contemporary Art, Los Angeles/Any Ever, The Power Plant, Toronto, Canada </p>
<p>&#149;&nbsp; <strong>2009 </strong> The Generational: Younger than Jesus, the New Museum, New York (group exhibition) </p>
<p>Heralded as the most &quot;of the now&quot; artists of our generation, their work is sometimes referred to as an attack on the senses. Ryan's videos are a fast paced barrage of pop culture parodies. &nbsp; The work is born of the over stimulation we all experience through computers, social networks, and reality TV. People now are &quot;speaking in 1st, 2nd, and 3rd person all at once&quot; Ryan said during an interview on <a href="http://www.france24.com/en/20111027-ryan-trecartin-lizzie-fitch-any-ever-musee-d%27art-moderne-paris-sempe-petit-nicholas-photography-eve-jackson-en-culture?page=1" target="_blank">France24.com</a>, we are interested in how &quot;people are constantly narrating their own story&quot;, &nbsp; &quot;editing their public and private personas in real time&quot;, and how we are all &quot;learning to communicate in that shifting reality&quot; says Lizzie. </p>
<p>This presentation is supported in part by a Community Arts Grant made possible by the City of New Orleans as administered by the Arts Council of New Orleans. </p>

  <em><strong>I vs. I (Tanner Stage II) </strong></em><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  On December 10 th , Alex Podesta opens<em> I vs. I (Tanner Stage II)</em>, a show of recent pieces, at The Front, St. Claude Ave, New Orleans. The title of this show is a reference to a medical scale that correlates social development and the growth of external physical markers. </p>
<p>In all of my recent work I have culled the rich fantasies, daydreams, misconceptions and experiences of childhood and re-contextualized them through the filters of adulthood, experience and education. This effort has been made in an attempt to plumb the depths of the creative and comprehensive naivet&eacute; of youth; to illustrate, in engaging and serio-comic ways, the role of fantasy, "othering" and conflict in nascent self-awareness; and, through the time honored tradition of solipsistic navel gazing, to pick gently at the loose thread of wistful escapism inherent in a quiet, down hill slide into maturity. </p>
<p>The central character in my works is usually found lost in a reverie of industriousness, paired with doppelganger or other machinations of his childish imagination. In concert, these figures toil at understanding, through experimentation or illustration, existential perplexities ranging from possibly surmountable commonplaces - e.g. What is loneliness and how is it combated? - To metaphysical impossibilities - e.g. Who is this god dude? And is he a hero? Like Superman? Or soldiers? Or knights on horseback? And what does hero mean anyway? Of course, no traction will ever be gained with these pursuits. These boys and toys and bunny/man chimera will be forever locked in the Sisyphean toil of misapplication, miscomprehension and misunderstanding. </p>

  <strong><em>In Search of the Cajun Prairie</em></strong><br>
  &nbsp;<br>
  Imagine trying to bake a cake that you and no one else you know has ever tasted. &nbsp; You have a list of possible ingredients but are clueless as to measurements and everything else. &nbsp; How would you begin? &nbsp;<em> In Search of the Cajun Prairie</em> is a collection of new drawings and paintings which imagine a landscape that I and no one else I know has ever seen. &nbsp; Not unlike the phantom cake, the Cajun Prairie exists today in bits and pieces scattered about the state with only written accounts of what it once looked like. &nbsp; Over 2.5 million acres of prairie once stretched across Louisiana, and it captured the fancy of early explorers and travel writers who visited the region. It is a significant part of Louisiana's ecological heritage that has been almost completely forgotten and lost. My work explores picking up the pieces I have to go on and putting them together in a hopeful imagining of what was and what could be. &nbsp; It is a dream.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

  <em>Special Ellipse </em></p>
<p><em>Special Ellipse</em> is a group show of time-based, projectable works -video, animated gifs, etc. Participants were asked to submit work within the formal or thematic concept of the 'circle.' Initially, two artists were invited to take part in the exhibition while also extending an invitation to one additional artist. This process was repeated until all of the included works were found. </p>
