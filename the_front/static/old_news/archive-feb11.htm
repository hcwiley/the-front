  <em><strong>Mine Eyes: Rachel DeTrinis, Lindsay Kane, Jason Leinwand</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p>There is a soulful prayer that cries out from the darkness of ones own chest, through listening the Light will present itself.  Some may not be able to hear their own chest, and they refuse to, it is my prayer that the Light finds you and guides you towards love.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Jesus said to them, &lsquo;The light will be among you only a little while.  Walk while you have the light, so that darkness may not overcome you.  Whoever walks in the dark does not know where he is going.  While you have the light, believe in the light, so that you may become children of the light.&rdquo;</p>
<p class="style17"><em>The New American Bible</em>. Saint Joseph Edition. John 12:35. Catholic Book Publishing Corp. New York. 1992</p>
<p>&ldquo;Early Friends proclaimed that from the beginning every person has been endowed with the capacity to enter directly, without mediator or mediation, into an empowering holy communion with God.  They rejected, therefore, the assumption that this communion, which is essential to spiritual health, occurs primarily in the presence of designated persons in an established religious institution using sacred language and rituals.  Friends, both in individual worship and in meetings for worship and for business, continue to experience the presence of the living God not only as awe and healing but also as guidance for conduct.  Like the prophets of Israel they proclaim the unity of religious faith and social justice. The Religious Society of Friends continues to affirm that refreshment of spirit and the ability both to know and do right come when families and individuals, in daily life and in meeting, trust in the Light that enlightens and empowers everyone who comes into the world.&rdquo; </p>

<p><em>&quot;'Faith&rsquo;, &lsquo;Love,&rsquo; and &lsquo;Hope&rsquo;</em><br>
  Faith of consciousness is freedom
Faith of feeling is weakness
Faith of body is stupidity. Love of consciousness evokes the same in response
Love of feeling evokes the opposite
Love of body depends only on type and polarity. Hope of consciousness is strength
Hope of feeling is slavery
Hope of body is disease.&rdquo;<br>

  <em>-G.I. Gurdjieff from Beelzebub&rsquo;s Tales to His Grandson</em><br>
  Jason Leinwand</p>
<p>I am just a medium. History and poetry provide no solace. I've made these talismans as a resurrection effort. It may take the tying of infinite threads to open a portal. In the hopes that physical representation achieves more than representation I will bring back the dead, and even this will be transitory. Discovering my teeth are the only part of my skeleton I will ever see, they are treasures. As linoleum is carved away, or acid bites into a line in the alchemy of print I find myself excavating other treasures that have been left behind. I am just a medium. This is what I found, what to wear, this is the map, this is the time and force needed. At 3 a.m. repeat this phrase 6 times, then 6 times, then 6 times,<em> &quot;You are alive again.&quot;</em></p>

<p>Room 3: Josephine Durkin<br>
  <strong><em>Suspended Here and Hovering There</em></strong><em></em></p>
<p>Josephine Durkin's research and studio practice has involved the creation of drawings, videos, sculptures, and large-scale, interactive and kinetic installations that personify recognizable or manipulated objects and materials.&nbsp; Recent works have investigated the use of particular color palettes to reference home d&eacute;cor and fashion.&nbsp; In this exhibition at The Front, Durkin has installed two sculptural installations that are part of a new, six-part series.&nbsp; <em>Layered Expansion (Golds) </em>and <em>Layered Expansion (Greens) </em>consist of stacked, striated, cast plastic shapes that visually hover in front of patterned stencils, which are suspended in front of partially painted walls.&nbsp; The physical acts that are usually linked to interior change and beautification (painting with rollers and stencils) are emphasized, while creating a relationship amongst the paint, patterns and objects.</p>

<p>Room 4: Paintings by Brooke Pickett, Suzanne Bennett, Morgana King<br>
  <strong><em>Everyday Abstract </em></strong><br>
</p>
<p>Brooke Pickett&rsquo;s work draws meaning from everyday objects with layers of paint like layers of time; she is building her own history. Brooke also runs Central City Artist Project, a residency program in the heart of Central City. <br>

<p>Suzanne Bennett will be artist in residence at A Studio in the Woods this March. Her residency project will constitute a &lsquo;psychic&rsquo; exploration combining urban elements of&nbsp;New Orleans with the natural elements of the Mississippi River and tertiary inlets, swamps, etc&nbsp;in the form of 5-6 large (approx 48 x 60&rdquo;) oil paintings. These paintings will be made up of two basic elements &ndash; images of the natural world and images of native people&rsquo;s specific memories of Louisiana. Her work uses other people&rsquo;s memories as a reference, so as in preparation for her residency Suzanne is asking the public to submit photos of their lives and histories in the Pelican State. These images will be worked into the paintings, as sort of a super-narrative, and incorporated with direct transcriptions of the surrounding landscape. In this way there will be a coming together of a myriad of elements: synthetic and natural, native and foreign, direct and circuitous, chaotic and circumscribed.&nbsp; The compositions will reflect the very complicated relationship we have to our environment and our world.&nbsp; <br>

<p>Morgana King is a member of The Front and the Director of Public Art at The Arts Council of New Orleans. The paintings are drawn from New Orleans plants and tropical climate. Inspired by nature, delicate balance, and fleeting moments, the work reflects my environment as translated by an obsessively doodling hand.&nbsp;&nbsp;<br></p></div>
