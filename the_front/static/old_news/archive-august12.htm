<p>Room 2: Ingrid Ludt</p>
<p>I listened to Coltrane. And approached the work like a jazz improviser who might choose a specific form or pattern and build it into a musical idea. Instead of notes I used imagery from the backwoods of my childhood; climbing vines, trailing roots and rocks from a familiar stream. The arrangement of space became very important to me. I wanted to include a certain amount of emptiness to allow the work to resonate with a deliberate presence. Like Coltrane hitting a high note.</p>
<p>Ingrid Ludt was born and raised in the Fingerlakes region of New York.

<p>Jennifer Moynihan<br>
  <em>New Works</em></p>
<p>In this new body of work, Jennifer Moynihan confronts everyday materials such as plastic, erasers and duct tape by deconstructing them in hopes of unveiling some unknown quality beneath that which is familiar and mundane.&nbsp;&nbsp;Her investigations of these manmade objects speak to an intimacy with her materials and a curiosity which appreciates the rewards of taking a deeper look.</p>
<p>Jennifer Moynihan relocated to New Orleans in 2011 from her native New York City.&nbsp; This will be the first exhibition of her work in Louisiana.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>

<p>Lee Deigaard<br>
  <em>a tree falls...</em></p>
<p>New photographs, videos, and drawings</p>
<p>A thing disregarded. An unknown event.&nbsp;<br>
  Examine minutely. Take the long view.<br>
  Recollect a longing, a precognition.&nbsp;<br>
  Relics survive the eye of the storm, the passage of time. Forensics rejects hindsight, considers the thing imagined.<br>
  <br>
  The world turns. The earth stood still.<br>
  A deer supine in leaves, perfect in body, without mark or wound.&nbsp;<br>
  Songbirds drop from the sky. The things they have seen and never told.&nbsp;<br>
  <br>
  Rise above. Things vanish. Washed away by the rain. Taken by the tornado. &nbsp;Grown small in the distance.<br>
  <br>
  New green growth among broken limbs and shattered trees. The hole in the sky has brought the sun. Soon, this will become the way it was.</p>
<p>Lee Deigaard is a member of The Front. Her work is also on view this month at the Ogden Museum of Southern Art in the group shows &quot;Louisiana Contemporary&quot; and &quot;New Southern Photography&quot; (Aug 4- Sept 23).</p>
