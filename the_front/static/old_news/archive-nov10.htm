<p><em><strong>Holly Hughes: The Dog &amp; Pony Show<br>
  </strong></em><br>
  <img src="newshow/Nov 13-Dec 5/hollyhughesDandPemailPR.jpg" alt="" width="345" height="460"></p>
<p>&quot;The Dog and Pony Show (Bring Your Own Pony)&quot; is a new solo performance written and performed by 2010 Guggenheim Fellow, Holly Hughes and directed by Dan Hurlin.&nbsp; A blend of autobiography, animal behavior, and bald faced lies, the show is a comic/poetic meditation on a midlife crisis in the key of canine.&nbsp; After several years as a self-described &quot;professional homosexual&quot; spent preaching to the perverted and getting into the craw of the religious right, Hughes disbands her one (wo)man dog and pony show, takes a real job at a prestigious university, acquiring a small pack of dogs, and must ask herself&quot; what is sound of one lesbian clapping? (Could it be barking?)<br>

</em></p>
<p>True love found, squandered then destroyed. It's a tale told countless times, and in country music&rsquo;s case, countless plus one. Glitter Chariot plan on taking the essence of this painful tale and filtering it through the fiberglass hay that littered 1970's music variety specials, combining it with their unique take on the Ernie and Bert relationship while adding a dash of stage theatrics to create a recipe for one of the more unique gallery going experiences one can have today. </p>
<p>Glitter Chariot's <em>Ribbon of Darkness</em> dares to be as ephemeral as a splash of stage blood or the flash of a camera but promises to remain with the viewer like the refrain of a haunting melody. Glitter Chariot is an ever-changing performance group lead by Ryan Berg with collaborators Chuck Carbia and Kelly Boehmer. Ribbon of Darkness will also include Lexi Braun, Jonny Warren, Ross Hayes and Kirsten Clauser. <br>

  <strong><em>A Selection of Maximalist Works</em></strong><br>
  <br>
  In <em>A Selection of Maximalist Works</em>, California-based artist Christopher Taggart presents a variety of sculpture and drawings from several trajectories of his multi-faceted practice. Included are several photosculptures; forms created by systematically photographing the surfaces of objects and assembling, in three dimensions, the resultant photographic prints. Also in the exhibition are several drawings from the series <em>Self Portrait as a Ghost</em>, based upon images found on the internet of individuals who share Taggart's name. Interwoven through the sculptures and drawings in the exhibition space is an anamorphic closed circuit video installation.&nbsp; Bits of tape and colored paper on the walls and ceiling are captured by a mechanically driven system of reflectors and a video camera to produce an animated drawing on a television set. </p>
<p>Christopher Taggart lives and works in Berkeley, California.&nbsp; His work has been shown in galleries and museums around the country, including the Drawing Center in New York, Ace Gallery in Los Angeles and New York, Arthur Roger Gallery in New Orleans, The Yerba Buena Center for the Arts in San Francisco, and Baer Ridgway Exhibitions in San Francisco.</p>

  <strong><em>Drawings<br>
    </em></strong><br>
  In addition to being the epicenter of soul in America and the home of some of my best friends, New Orleans is also a place of personal origin to me.&nbsp;&nbsp;In tracing my family genealogy, I found that my great grandfather was born into slavery in Louisiana in 1860 and migrated North to D.C. around 1880, most likely from New Orleans.&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in New York, the disaster of Katrina shook me to the core and radically changed my perspectives.&nbsp; I was inspired at that time to explore the possibility of an iconic symbol like the cross. &nbsp;I imagined one  that had, by some great force, emptied of its content and severed from the context of religion.&nbsp;The act of drawing these compulsively repeated, intersecting rectangular solids was about as close to praying as I have ever been.</p>
<p>Marc Andre Robinson's work revolves around a psychology of historical, cultural and familial belonging. His&nbsp;drawings are often marked by meticulous patterning and repetition. He will debut two large-scale drawings at The Front.&nbsp; </p>

  Curated by Holly Hughes &amp; Lee Deigaard, featuring work by Kathy High<br>
  <br>
  STANDING HEAT featuring Kathy High, curated by Holly Hughes &amp; Lee Deigaard </p>
<p>In conjunction with Holly Hughes' performance of her new work, &quot;The Dog and Pony Show&quot;, Standing Heat explores relationships between companion animals and humans. &nbsp; Small 2D works from an international call for entries respond to Gertrude Stein's assertion: &quot;I am I because my little dog knows me,&quot; whereby &quot;little dog&quot; references any species of companion. &nbsp; Who is it whom your &quot;little dog&quot; knows, and how is your sense of self mediated through this relationship? </p>
<p>Featured are new works by the internationally known new media artist Kathy High that consider interspecies communication and animal-human ways of thinking about one another. &nbsp; In &quot;Lily Does Derrida&quot;, a video essay with posthumous commentary by Lily Dog, Lily looks at Derrida's writings and makes a case for how humans and non-humans understand one another- or not- based on her own life and adventures. &nbsp; Jacques Derrida wrote about animal consciousness and animal subjectivity in &quot;The Animal That Therefore I Am.&quot; &nbsp; Photographs documenting lethal encounters between cars and peeper frogs and a mixed media sculptural piece, &quot;The Pull of Burden Waters&quot; consider life and death issues on Burden Lake in upstate New York where High lives. </p>
<p>Works by Lee Deigaard consider concepts of the self as defined by dog and the intersections and boundaries of canine-human domesticity. &nbsp; Also including a video self-portrait by Dave Greber, and works by Steve Baker, Ryan Ballard, Toni Billick, Joyce Brienza, Helen Bullard, Steve Coy, Sean Darby, Kimberly Gaul, Jan Harrison, Megan Hildebrandt, Rachael House, Mik Morrisey, Lyssa Oberkreser, Penny Perkins, Bernadette Preger, Alice Richardson, Kate Roesch, Cynthia Scott, Lori E. Seid, Daniel Slate, and Megan Williamson. </p>
<p>HOLLY HUGHES is a writer and performer, a "thespian's thespian." Or in the words of former National Endowment for the Arts Chairman John Frohnmayer: "Holly Hughes is a lesbian and her work is very heavily of that genre." Other admirers have been more succinct; the late Senator Jesse Helms called her "a garbage artist," and the Village Voice remarked "She's hell on heels." Perhaps the best summary of &nbsp; her body of work which includes 15 solo and group performance pieces was offered by the LA Times: "Holly Hughes is everything you ever wanted in a lesbian performance artist and less." &nbsp;&nbsp; Born in Saginaw, Michigan, Hughes attended Kalamazoo College, escaping to New York City in the twilight of the Carter years. &nbsp;&nbsp; She came out as a thespian at the WOW Caf&eacute;, New York City's self declared "Home for Wayward Girls." Hughes's work includes plays such as "The Well of Horniness," "Dress Suits to Hire," and "Let Them Eat Cake" and solos include: "World Without End," "Clit Notes," "Preaching to the Perverted," and "The Dog and Pony Show (Bring your own Pony.) &nbsp;&nbsp; Five of her plays are included in "Clit Notes: A Sapphic Sampler, " published by Grove. &nbsp;&nbsp; She is also co-editor with David Roman of "O Solo Homo: The New queer Performance,' which received a Lambda Book award. A 2010 Guggenheim Fellow, Hughes is an associate professor at the University of Michigan, with appointments in Art and Design, Theatre and Drama and Women's Studies. </p>
<p>KATHY HIGH is a visual/media artist from New York working in the intersections of art and biology. She produces videos and installations posing queer and feminist questions into areas of medicine/bio-science, science fiction, and animal/interspecies collaborations. Her art works have been screened in galleries and museums nationally and internationally. In 2010 she was awarded a fellowship from the Guggenheim Foundation. K. High is an Associate Professor of Video and new Media at the Department of Arts at Rensselaer Polytechnic Institute, Troy, NY, a department specializing in integrated electronic arts practices. In the last ten years she has become interested in working with living systems, animals and biology and art. </p>
<p>LEE DEIGAARD is a New Orleans-based artist and member of The Front. &nbsp; Her work in a variety of media explores animal-human communication and the animal protagonist and, most recently, in her series of nocturnal portraits, ideas of autonomy, trespass, and cross-species artistic collaboration. &nbsp; Her Memorial to Topsy the elephant is on permanent display at the Coney Island Museum in Brooklyn, NY.</p>
