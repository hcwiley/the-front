<p>Andrew Miller<br>
  <em><strong>Brand Spirit</strong></em></p>
<p>Andrew Miller is obsessed with understanding what it means to live in a branded world, where we associate our identities with the brands and products we buy. These images are part of Brand Spirit, a series of photographs shot every day for 100 days. <br>
  <br>
  &ldquo;By reducing the objects to a single color and consistent scale, I found unexpected relationships between them. I never imagined a box of cigarettes would have such similarity to a box of crayons.&rdquo; <br>
  <br>
  Each image was chosen to represent a particular concept, from commentaries on consumer culture to celebrations of our most loved brands.<br>
  <br>
  Limited edition prints are available from 20x200 @ www.20x200.com<br>
  The full collection of Brand Spirit can be seen online at: <a href="http://www.brandspirit.tumblr.com" target="_blank">www.brandspirit.tumblr.com</a><br>

<p>Philip Berezney<br>
  <em><strong>STUFF</strong> <strong><br>
    and also,<br>
  STUFF Moving, (several other items, performed during the opening)</strong></em><strong></strong></p>
<p>This is a show of Stuff Stuffed with Stuff. Philip Berezney wanted to make stupid things out of beautiful fabric, and he wanted to make beautiful things out of stupid fabric. This collection of sculptures has to do with seeing the outsides of things and imagining what their insides look like.</p>
<p>We develop an ability, when we are very young, to discover discrepancies between appearance and reality. Somebody told me that when I breathe, stuff inside of me is doing things that I don&rsquo;t know about, scientifically. Sometimes I also want things or make them up. I didn&rsquo;t put my organs inside of me &ndash; they grew there &ndash; I&rsquo;ve never seen them, and I don&rsquo;t really know what it looks like in there. A changeable relationship between interior and exterior exists in these sculptures, as it does in the body; the shape of what is inside affects the shape of what is outside. Each object&rsquo;s identity is formed and in-formed by the relationship between its inner and outer parts.</p>
<p>Things fill things, and things surround things. Things cover things, and things are unseen. Parts sit, parts hang, parts stretch, parts touch. Some parts connect to each other in places to form openings. Folds meet and are sealed. (<em>Someone has trapped hammers and clothespins and furniture and containers in cotton or felt or other, synthetic kinds of skins&hellip; and stitched it all up!</em>) These things are almost alive and sort of dead, I think.</p>
<p>Philip Berezney is a multidisciplinary artist with interests across both visual and performing arts. He has lived in New Orleans since 2010, after graduating from Bard College with a B.A. in Studio Arts. This is his first exhibition as a visual artist in New Orleans.</p>
<p>Philip has worked locally as a choreographer with Twos and Ones Performance Collective, creating and performing original works shown at the Contemporary Arts Center, Washington Park, Zeitgeist Multidisciplinary Arts Center, and Michalopoulos Studios. He currently holds a residency with the Marigny Opera House, where he is developing a new dance work to be performed this fall, entitled, <em>Having Our Appendix Out</em>. He also frequently collaborates with Skin Horse Theater Company as a performer and costume designer. </p>
